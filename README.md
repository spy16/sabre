# Sabre

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/spy16/sabre?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/spy16/sabre) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/spy16/sabre)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/spy16/sabre) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spy16/sabre.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spy16/sabre)

Sabre is highly customizable, embeddable LISP engine for Go.

## Features

* Highly Customizable reader/parser through a read table (Inspired by Clojure) (See [Reader](#reader))
* Built-in data types: nil, bool, string, number, character, keyword, symbol, list, vector, set, module
* Multiple number formats supported: decimal, octal, hexadecimal, radix and scientific notations.
* Full unicode support. Symbols can include unicode characters (Example: `find-Î´`, `Ï€`, `ðŸ§ ` etc.)
* Character Literals with support for:
  1. simple literals  (e.g., `\a` for `a`)
  2. special literals (e.g., `\newline`, `\tab` etc.)
  3. unicode literals (e.g., `\u00A5` for `Â¥` etc.)
* Clojure style built-in special forms: `Î»` or `fn*`, `def`, `if`, `do`, `throw`, `let*`
* Simple interface `sabre.Value` (and optional `sabre.Invokable`) for adding custom
  data types. (See [Evaluation](#evaluation))
* *Slang* (Short for Sabre Lang): A tiny reference LISP dialect built using Sabre.
  * Contains an Interpreter with REPL.
  * Some basic standard functions.

> Please note that Sabre is _NOT_ an implementation of a particular LISP dialect. It provides
> pieces that can be used to build a LISP dialect or can be used as a scripting layer.

## Usage

> Sabre requires Go 1.13 or higher.

### As Embedded Script Engine

Sabre has concept of `Scope` which is responsible for maintaining bindings. You can bind
any Go value and access it using LISP code, which makes it possible to expose parts of your
API and make it scriptable or build your own LISP dialect. Also, See [Extending](#extending)
for more information on customizing the reader or eval.

```go
package main

import "github.com/spy16/sabre"

func main() {
    scope := sabre.NewScope(nil)
    scope.BindGo("inc", func(v int) int {
      return v+1
    })

    result, _:= sabre.ReadEvalStr(scope, "(inc 10)")
    fmt.Printf("Result: %v\n", result) // should print "Result: 11"
}
```

### Expose through a REPL

Sabre comes with a tiny `repl` package that is very flexible and easy to setup
to expose your LISP setup through a read-eval-print-loop.

```go
package main

import (
  "log"

  "github.com/spy16/sabre"
  "github.com/spy16/sabre/repl"
)

func main() {
  scope := sabre.NewScope(nil)
  scope.BindGo("inc", func(v int) int {
    return v+1
  })

  repl.New(scope,
    repl.WithBanner("Welcome to my own LISP!"),
    repl.WithPrompts("=>", "|"),
    // many more options available
  ).Loop(context.Background())
}
```

### Standalone

Sabre has a small reference LISP dialect named ***Slang*** (short for *Sabre Lang*) for
which a standalone binary is available.

1. Install Slang into `GOBIN` path: `go get -u -v github.com/spy16/sabre/cmd/slang`
2. Run:
   1. `slang` for REPL
   2. `slang -e "(+ 1 2 3)"` for executing string
   3. `slang -f "examples/simple.lisp"` for executing file

> If you specify both `-f` and `-e` flags, file will be executed first and then the
> string will be executed in the same scope and you will be dropped into REPL. If
> REPL not needed, use `-norepl` option.

## Extending

### Reader

Sabre reader is inspired by Clojure reader and uses a _read table_. Reader supports
following forms:

* Numbers:
  * Integers use `int64` Go representation and can be specified using decimal, binary
    hexadecimal or radix notations. (e.g., 123, -123, 0b101011, 0xAF, 2r10100, 8r126 etc.)
  * Floating point numbers use `float64` Go representation and can be specified using
    decimal notation or scientific notation. (e.g.: 3.1412, -1.234, 1e-5, 2e3, 1.5e3 etc.)
* Characters: Characters use `rune` or `uint8` Go representation and can be written in 3 ways:
  * Simple: `\a`, `\Î»`, `\Î²` etc.
  * Special: `\newline`, `\tab` etc.
  * Unicode: `\u1267`
* Boolean: `true` or `false` are converted to `Bool` type.
* Nil: `nil` is represented as a zero-allocation empty struct in Go.
* Keywords: Keywords are like symbols but start with `:` and evaluate to themselves.
* Symbols: Symbols can be used to name a value and can contain any Unicode symbol.
* Lists: Lists are zero or more forms contained within parenthesis. (e.g., `(1 2 3)`, `(1 [])`).
  Evaluating a list leads to an invocation.
* Vectors: Vectors are zero or more forms contained within brackets. (e.g., `[]`, `[1 2 3]`)
* Sets: Set is a container for zero or more unique forms. (e.g. `#{1 2 3}`)

Reader can be extended to add new syntactical features by adding _reader macros_
to the _read table_. _Reader Macros_ are implementations of `sabre.ReaderMacro`
function type. _Except numbers and symbols, everything else supported by the reader
is implemented using reader macros_.

### Evaluation

Eval logic for standard data types is fixed. But custom `sabre.Value` types can be
implemented to customize evaluation logic.

In addition, `sabre.Value` types can also implement `sabre.Invokable` interface to
enable invocation. For example `Vector` uses this to enable Clojure style element
access using `([1 2 3] 0)` (returns `1`)
